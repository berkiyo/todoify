## What is the difference between "infinity" and "infinity-app" repo?

Originally, I was developing the app on the iPad using Swift Playgrounds and it is working nicely however, sometimes I want to simulate the app on different screen sizes but also take advantage of Xcode's advanced features.

I had the plan of having a separate folder for the Xcode project and simply push/merge the changes of the Xcode version there however, this caused issues for me so I decided to keep them separate. 

- Infinity = App developed with Swift Playgrounds IDE (upstream)
- infinity-app = Clone of the Swift Playgrounds app, just using Xcode to develop the app.

Both repositories should be 1:1 when it comes to code parity. Depending on how things go, only one will be the primary repo used for developing the app.
